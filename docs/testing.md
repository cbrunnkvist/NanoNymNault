# Testing (stub)

This is a stub documentation file for testing guidance.

- All npm-driven tasks on macOS should use the nvm wrapper as per AGENTS.md:
  - Example: `nvm exec npm test`, `nvm exec npm run build`, etc.
- Eventually this file will contain full testing strategy, commands, and CI guidance.
